/*
Rev. 2.8 Copyright © 2006 by Silicon Laboratories AN117
USING THE C8051FXXX ON-CHIP INTERFACE UTILITIES DLL
Relevant Devices
This application note applies to all Silicon Laboratories C8051Fxxx devices.
 
 *  
 * 1. Introduction
 * 
The Interface Utilities DLL (Dynamic Link Library) provides the following functionality: download an Intel hex file to
Flash; connect and disconnect to a C8051Fxxx processor; “Run” and “Halt” the microprocessor; and read and write
internal, external, and code memory spaces. All this functionality is provided via a PC’s COM port or USB port and
a Silicon Laboratories Debug Adapter.
When using C++, the functions described in this document must be declared as imported functions. Add the C++
Prototype to the header file (*.h) of the source file (*.cpp) from which the function will be called.
The procedures and guidelines presented in this document illustrate how to link the Interface Utilities DLL to a
client executable. A DLL is not a standalone application. It is a library of exported functions that are linked at runtime
and called by a Microsoft Windows® application. To write a client using Visual Basic please refer to Section 14
on page 17 for more information.
An example Interface Utilities application (including program source code) is provided along with the Interface
Utilities DLL as a means of testing or using the Utilities DLL as a base application. The Interface Utilities application
uses implicit linking, which requires the DLL to be placed in a specific directory (see Section 11 on page 16).
 
 * 
 * 2. Files and Compatibility
 * 
The latest versions of the “SiUtil.dll” and “SiUtil.lib”, are available at www.silabs.com. The DLL is a Win32 MFC
Regular DLL meaning it uses the Microsoft Foundation Class libraries. It can be loaded by any Win32 programming
environment, and only exports ‘C’ style functions. Two versions are currently available, one in which the MFC
(Microsoft Foundations Classes) library is statically linked in the DLL, and another version in which the MFC library
is dynamically linked in the DLL.
The statically linked MFC version includes a copy of all the MFC library code it needs and is thus self contained. No
external MFC linking is required. With the MFC library code included, the statically linked DLL will be larger in size
than the dynamically linked version.
The dynamically linked MFC version is smaller in size than the static version. However, the dynamically linked DLL
requires that files “MFC42.dll” and “MSVCRT.dll” be present on the target machine. This is not a problem if the
client program is dynamically linked to the same version (Version 4.2) or newer of the MFC library (i.e., uses MFC
as a shared library). The required MFC DLLs “MFC42.dll” and “MSVCRT.dll” are provided along with the
dynamically linked MFC version of the Utility Programmer DLL. Do not replace equivalent or newer versions of
these files if they are already present on the target machine.

Connected() - Returns the connection state of the target C8051Fxxx device.
 
 *  
 * 3.1. Connect()
 * 
Description: This function is used to connect to a target C8051Fxxx device using a Serial Adapter. Establishing
a valid connection is necessary for all memory operations to succeed.
Supported Debug Adapters: Serial Adapter
C++ Prototype: extern “C” __declspec(dllimport) int__stdcall Connect(int nComPort=1,
int nDisableDialogBoxes=0, int nECprotocol=0, int nBaudRateIndex=0);
Parameters: 1. nComPort—Target COM port to establish a connection. The default is ‘1’.
2. nDisableDialogBoxes—Disable (1) or enable (0) dialogs boxes within the DLL. The default is ‘0’.
3. nECprotocol—Connection protocol used by the target device; JTAG (0) or Silicon Laboratories
2-Wire (C2) (1). The default is ‘0’. The C2 interface is used with C8051F3xx derivative devices
and the JTAG interface is used with C8051F0xx, C8051F1xx, and C8051F2xx derivative
devices.
4. nBaudRateIndex—Target baud rate to establish a connection; Autobaud detection (0), 115200
(1), 57600 (2), 38400 (3), 9600 (4) or 2400 (5). The default is ‘0’.
Return Value: See Table 1 on page 16.
 
 *  
 * 3.2. Disconnect()
 * 
Description: This function is used to disconnect from a target C8051Fxxx device using a Serial Adapter.
Supported Debug Adapters: Serial Adapter
C++ Prototype: extern “C” __declspec(dllimport) int__stdcall Disconnect(int nComPort=1);
Parameters: 1. nComPort - COM port in use by current connection. The default is ‘1’.
Return Value: See Table 1 on page 16.

 * 
 * 3.3. ConnectUSB()
 * 
Description: This function is used to connect to a target C8051Fxxx device using a USB Debug Adapter.
Establishing a valid connection is necessary for all memory operations to succeed.
Supported Debug Adapters: USB Debug Adapter
C++ Prototype: extern “C” __declspec(dllimport) int__stdcall ConnectUSB(
const char * sSerialNum=””, int nECprotocol=0, int nPowerTarget=0,
int nDisableDialogBoxes=0);
Parameters: 
 1. sSerialNumber—The serial number of the USB Debug Adapter. See Section 8 for information
on obtaining the serial number of each USB Debug Adapter connected. If only one USB
Debug Adapter is connected, an empty string can be used. The default is an empty string.
2. nECprotocol—Connection protocol used by the target device; JTAG (0) or Silicon Laboratories
2-Wire (C2) (1). The default is ‘0’. The C2 interface is used with C8051F3xx derivative devices
and the JTAG interface is used with C8051F0xx, C8051F1xx, and C8051F2xx derivative
devices.
3. nPowerTarget—If this parameter is set to ‘1’, the USB Debug Adapter will be configured to
continue supplying power after it has been disconnected from the target device. The default is
‘0’, configuring the adapter to discontinue supplying power when disconnected.
4. nDisableDialogBoxes—Disable (1) or enable (0) dialogs boxes within the DLL. The default is ‘0’.

Return Value: See Table 1 on page 16.


 * 
 * 11. Linking
 * 
Unless using explicit linking, it is necessary to provide the linker with the path of the “SiUtil.lib” library file before
building the client executable. In Microsoft Visual C++ this is accomplished by selecting Settings… from the Project
menu and then the Link tab. In the Object/library modules box enter the full path and filename of the library file. For
example; “c:\project\release\SiUtil.lib”. The library file is not needed after the client executable is built.
If the DLL is implicitly linked, the DLL must be placed in one the following directories:
1. The directory containing the EXE client file.
2. The process’s current directory.
3. The Windows System directory.
4. The Windows directory.
5. A directory listed in the PATH environment variable.
12. Test Results
On exit, the DLL will return an integer value return code. If a fatal error occurs during the DLL’s execution, the DLL
will also display a message box, if display dialogs are enabled, stating the error and then exit. The return codes are
listed in Table 1.
 ******************************************************************************

 * 
 * 13. Known Limitations
 * 
Upon invocation of the DLL in the debug mode of a client process, dialog messaging may not function properly.
Dialog messaging provides a client with a way to get instant information that may not otherwise be available.
Dialog messaging supports a progress indicator that provides a client with information on the progress of memory
operations that may take time to complete. Calling into the DLL with a client (in debug version) may cause the DLL
to misinterpret the correct window handle used to display the dialog boxes. The recommended course of action is
to set all functions that have a nDisableDialogBoxes parameter to ‘1’ before calling DLL functions. All
nDisableDialogBoxes parameters default to ‘0’. This problem will not occur in the release mode of a client process.

 * 
 * 14. Visual Basic Information
 * 
When writing a Visual Basic client it is important to note that the Interface Utilities DLL is written using Visual C++.
Thus, you must take into account variable type differences between the two languages. Specifically, the VC++
boolean type and the VB boolean type are incompatible. In VC++ TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0, whereas in VB
TRUE = –1 and FALSE = 0. To resolve this issue you must use an integer instead of a boolean when writing your
VB client and send an integer value 1 for TRUE and integer value 0 for FALSE.
